# NodeJS

## Imports and Exports

NodeJS allows for the importing and exporting for individual NodeJS files called
modules. In order to import an file we use the require syntax.

```js
const library = require('./library')
```

And in order to export functionality in a module file we must make use of the
module.exports API. Any object or function set as a property of the exports
object is available to be imported in from other files.

```js
const car = {
    brand: 'Ford',
    model: 'Fiesta',
}

module.exports = car
```

We can now import our new car object like so.

```js
const Ford = require('./ford.js')

console.log(Ford.brand)
// -> Ford
```

In example 1 set exports equal to the car object. However we may at times want
to export multiple objects of functions in a file. In order to do this we'd
modify the example above like this.

```js
const car = {
    brand: 'Ford',
    model: 'Fiesta',
}

exports.car = car
```

```js
const items = require('./items')
const car = items.car
```

### Main Module

When a file is run directly through Node.JS `require.main` is set equal to the
directly executed module. Consequently you are able to check if a module was run
directly by checking if `require.main === module`.

### Package Manager Tips

The require module is formatted The require module is formatted in a manner to
support resonable directory structures. It's compatible with package managers
such as `dkpg`, `npm`, `rpm`, etc.. Let's consider an example directory structure
for the foo package.

`/ur/lib/node<some-package>/<some-version>`
